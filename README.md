# bara

Blazing-fast **ARA viewer** — a Rust runtime that parses, serves, and renders
Agent-Native Research Artifacts (ARAs) as an interactive, drill-down DAG in the
browser. (`bara` = *blazing ara*.)

`bara` is an **independent, community-built** runtime for the ARA format. Point
it at any ARA directory and it validates, lays out, and serves an interactive
viewer locally — no hub account, no build step, no LLM calls at view time.

> Status: released, `0.1.x`. `ara validate`, `ara layout`, and `ara serve`
> (live-reloading web viewer) all work. See `plans/ara-runtime-impl-plan.md`
> for the design and `docs/` for the shipped-stage write-ups.

## Why bara?

The official ARA project defines the format and hosts a hub where each artifact
is published with its own pre-baked viewer page. `bara` is a **local-first,
deterministic alternative** you run yourself. The differences are deliberate
design decisions, not accidents:

- **Renders the YAML directly — never calls an LLM at view time.** Reference ARA
  viewers ship a static, upstream-baked HTML page per artifact (prose generated
  once, then frozen). `bara` reads `exploration_tree.yaml` + `claims.md` and
  renders them **deterministically** every load, so the view is byte-reproducible
  and always matches the source on disk. Missing upstream prose degrades
  gracefully to the structured fields — it is never faked at view time.
- **One shared Rust core, no parser drift.** `ara-core` compiles to **both**
  native and `wasm32`. The exact code that `ara validate` checks on the CLI is
  the code that lays out and renders in the browser — validation and view can't
  disagree.
- **Tolerant of the *real* corpus, not just the two published examples.** The
  parser ingests messy, hand-authored artifacts without panicking: unknown
  fields become warnings (not hard errors), `children` + `also_depends_on`
  cycles are detected, and source order is preserved. See
  `docs/ara-format-feedback.md`.
- **Small, fast, accessible client.** Leptos (CSR) + SVG ships a sub-megabyte
  wasm bundle with **selectable, searchable (Ctrl-F), ARIA-accessible** text and
  native browser zoom — things a canvas/WebGL viewer can't give you. Node kind
  is encoded by **glyph + label, not colour alone**, so the graph stays readable
  for colour-blind users; only dead-ends use a warning colour.
- **Deterministic layered DAG layout.** The Sugiyama-style layout runs inside
  `ara-core` and is byte-stable across native and wasm, which makes it
  snapshot-testable — the same artifact always draws the same graph.
- **Local-first, self-hostable, single binary.** `ara serve` watches the ARA
  directory and live-reloads on change (preserving pan/zoom/selection). The
  browser frontend is embedded into the `ara` binary, so there is one artifact to
  ship and no external services to run.
- **Open and independent.** MPL-2.0, no telemetry, no lock-in, and an active
  feedback loop with the format maintainer (`docs/ara-format-feedback.md`).

Use `bara` when you want to explore ARAs **on your own machine**, keep the
rendering faithful to the source, script it into CI/validation, or view
artifacts that never went through the hub.
