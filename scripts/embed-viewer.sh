# embed-viewer.sh — regenerate (or freshness-check) the viewer bundle that
# `ara-cli` bakes into its binary via `include_dir!`.
#
# `ara serve` embeds a prebuilt `trunk` bundle (crates/ara-cli/assets/viewer/)
# so `cargo install ara-cli` works with no wasm toolchain. The cost: those
# committed bytes lag the ara-viewer *source* until someone regenerates them.
# This script is the single canonical regen path, plus a `--check` mode CI runs
# to fail the build when the embed is stale.
#
# Freshness is tracked by a content hash of the frontend SOURCE INPUTS (not the
# build output). Build output (wasm) is not guaranteed byte-reproducible across
# machines/toolchains, so a byte-diff of the bundle would be flaky; a source
# hash is deterministic and toolchain-independent.
#
# Scope/limitation: the hash covers the ara-viewer crate's own inputs (src/,
# public/, index.html, Trunk.toml, Cargo.toml). A change that only touches an
# upstream crate (e.g. ara-core) can alter the compiled wasm without changing
# this hash — regenerate manually after such changes.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/embed-viewer.sh            # rebuild + copy into assets/viewer/ + write hash
#   scripts/embed-viewer.sh --check    # recompute hash, compare to committed; nonzero if stale
#
