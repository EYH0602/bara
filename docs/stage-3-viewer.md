# Stage 3 — `ara-viewer`: Leptos wasm viewer (static manifest)

Design record for the browser client shipped in Stage 3. It renders a
checked-in static `manifest.json` (produced by `ara layout --json`) as an
interactive, drill-down DAG in the **published ARA visual language**. No server
yet — that is Stage 4; Stage 3 proves the render path end to end and leaves the
seams Stage 4 slots into.

Companion docs: [`manifest-schema.md`](manifest-schema.md) (the frozen wire
shape), [`stage-3-svg-spike.md`](stage-3-svg-spike.md) (the SVG-vs-canvas gate +
fps/size measurements).

## What shipped

A Leptos 0.8 CSR app built with [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev) in
`crates/ara-viewer` (the reserved umbrella crate, repurposed from its stub
binary into a `lib` + thin `bin`). It:

- reads the `ara_core::Manifest` over the wire via `serde_json` (no hand-written
  TS; the empty `ara-wasm` skeleton was **dropped** — the viewer needs no
  hand-written interop);
- renders the DAG as declarative **SVG** from Stage-2 `Node.pos` +
  `Manifest.bounds`, skinned to the published token set;
- renders a **DOM drill-down pane** with the published detail structure;
- degrades gracefully for every field the schema does not yet carry.

Milestone: `trunk serve` (or `trunk build --release` + a static server — a CSR
app's `fetch` needs an HTTP context, not `file://`), then navigate a real tree:
pan/zoom the skinned SVG, click/keyboard-select nodes, read the per-kind
drill-down. Dead ends are unmistakable without relying on colour. Every
load/empty/error state is handled.

## Design system (from the published `research-visualizer` scaffold)

The viewer looks and behaves like the already-published ARA viewer, not a new
visual direction. Warm-cream light theme, single terracotta accent; **node kind
is read from a glyph + lowercase badge, never from colour** — only `dead_end` is
coloured (`--warn`, white ink), which keeps the encoding colourblind-safe. The
token set is vendored verbatim into `public/styles.css`:

| Token | Value | Use |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `--bg` | `#faf6ef` | app background |
| `--panel` / `--panel2` | `#fffdf8` / `#f4ecdf` | surfaces |
| `--ink` / `--muted` | `#2f2a23` / `#90856f` | text / secondary text |
| `--accent` | `#bf6a2e` | single accent (selection, spines, links) |
| `--warn` / `--ok` | `#a23b2d` / `#5d7c3f` | dead_end / positive status |
| `--glyph-bg` / `--glyph-ink` | `#e7ddca` / `#5a5142` | neutral kind glyph |
| `--sel-bg` | `#f7ead2` | selected node fill |

Body `ui-sans-serif`, ids/code `ui-monospace`. No new palette, no default font
stack. A two-pane `<main>` grid `minmax(320px, 38%) 1fr` — left `#map`
(exploration tree), right `#detail` (drill-down) — that stacks to a single
column below 800px.

## Architecture

Crate layout (`lib` + `bin` so components are import-testable):

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `lib.rs` | `App` shell + `MapPane`; owns the view-state signals |
| `main.rs` | 8-line binary → `ara_viewer::mount()` |
| `kind.rs` | `kind_meta(&NodeKind)` — the single source of truth for wire css class / glyph / badge |
| `state.rs` | `LoadState`, `MapSurface`/`map_surface`, `safe_viewbox`, `PanZoom`/`ViewState`/`apply_manifest`, `parse_manifest` |
| `source.rs` | `ManifestSource` seam + the wasm-only `fetch_manifest` |
| `scene.rs` | pure scene model + `GraphRenderer` trait + `SvgRenderer` + the interactive `GraphView` |
| `detail.rs` | pure `detail_model` + the `DetailPane` component |
| `filter.rs` | `FilterState` + the pure `node_matches` predicate |
| `toolbar.rs` | the header `Toolbar` component |
| `canvas.rs` | `CanvasRenderer` stub (the fps contingency, unbuilt) |

Three ideas keep the stage honest and Stage-4-ready:

- **`GraphRenderer` = pure scene-model trait**, not view-returning. `scene(&Manifest, &LayoutView)`
  computes a `GraphScene { nodes:[{id, rect, kind, glyph, …}], edges:[{path,
  link_kind}], bounds }`; `SvgRenderer` renders that scene to SVG; a future
  `CanvasRenderer` renders the same scene to canvas. **Edge paths are derived
  client-side** from a `NodeId → pos` map (there is no `Link.route` in the
  schema); a node/edge with `pos: None` or an unknown endpoint is skipped, never
  panicked. Scene compute is pure → native-unit-tested (no browser).
- **`ManifestSource` seam** — `Static(url)` (fetch `manifest.json`) now;
  `Api { endpoint, live }` documented for Stage 4. `apply_manifest` preserves
  selection + pan/zoom, making the Stage-4 live-reload survival promise concrete.
- **Schema is authoritative.** All rendering binds to the frozen Stage-2
  `Manifest`. CSS classes bind to the serde **snake_case wire form**
  (`dead_end`, `depends_on`, …) via `kind_meta`. For `NodeKind::Other(raw)` the
  CSS class is the fixed sanitized token `other`; the raw string is display text
  only, never a class name.

View-state (`selected`, `pan_zoom`, `filter`) lives as signals in `App`, above
the scene render, so a Stage-4 manifest swap will not reset it.

## Render behaviour

- **Graph (`#map`)** — one interactive `<g>` per node: glyph chip + `label ?? id`
  clamped to 2 lines + ellipsis (full text in `<title>`); kind badge; `dead_end`
  coloured + strikethrough. `Child` edges solid, `DependsOn` dashed. Selected
  (`--sel-bg` + accent border) and focus (distinct dashed ring) states. Pan/zoom
  is a single reactive `viewBox` update (wheel zoom clamped 0.2–5.0, pointer-drag
  pan). Nodes are `tabindex=0`, `role="button"`, `aria-label = "label, kind"`;
  Enter/Space selects.
- **Detail (`#detail`)** — header (`label ?? id`, kind chip+badge, `support_level`
  pill) → description → per-kind typed fields in canonical order (`Experiment`:
  result; `Decision`: choice → rationale → alternatives; `DeadEnd`: `why_failed`
  as the primary `.block.reason` lead; `Question`/`Insight`/`Other`: none) →
  evidence notes + claims resolved through `bindings` with
  supported/refuted/hypothesis status pills → `source_refs` provenance chips.
  Empty nodes show "Nothing recorded for this node."; every block is omitted when
  its data is absent. Richer blocks (quote/figure/table/diff/glossary/deps/recipe)
  are skinned but **inert pending `T-REAL-CORPUS`**. No LLM is called at view time.
- **Toolbar** — case-insensitive search (label/id/kind/bound-claim text), a type
  `<select>` (options derived from kinds present), and a "dead ends only"
  checkbox. Non-matching nodes are **dimmed** (`.node.dimmed`), never removed, so
  the graph shape stays stable. Selection is independent of the filter.

### Interaction states (all handled)

| Surface | State | User sees |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| manifest fetch | loading | "Loading artifact…" skeleton |
| manifest fetch | load failure | error card: "Couldn't load manifest" + reason |
| graph | empty (`nodes: []`) | "No nodes in this artifact." + safe `viewBox` |
| node | `pos: None` | skipped in scene compute; never panics |
| detail | no selection | "Select a step on the left." |
| detail | node with no fields | "Nothing recorded for this node." |
| node | `Other`/unknown kind | neutral glyph + raw-kind badge (fixed `other` class) |

## Tests & CI

Two layers, split by the eng review:

- **Native `cargo test`** (no browser) — the pure logic: `kind_meta`, scene
  compute / edge derive / `pos:None` skip, `map_surface` + `safe_viewbox`,
  `apply_manifest` preservation, `detail_model` per-kind ordering + claim
  resolution + degradation, and the `node_matches` filter predicate; plus a
  round-trip that the checked-in `manifest.json` parses into `Manifest`. All
  browser-only code (`fetch_manifest`, `gloo-net`) is `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]`
  so the native workspace build stays green.
- **`wasm-bindgen-test` headless-browser layer** (`tests/web.rs`, gated to
  wasm32) — mounts `GraphView`/`DetailPane` with a synthetic manifest and asserts
  node/edge counts + classes, node a11y attributes, click→detail sync,
  search→dimming sync, the per-kind detail hierarchy, bound-claim rendering, and
  degradation. Run in CI by the `viewer-web-test` job (`wasm-pack test --headless
  --chrome`).

**Build gates.** A `[profile.wasm-release]` (`opt-level="z"`, `lto="fat"`,
`codegen-units=1`, `panic="abort"`, `strip`) is selected only for release/CI via
`TRUNK_BUILD_CARGO_PROFILE`, so `trunk serve` dev stays fast. `wasm-opt -Oz`
runs in the Trunk build (`data-wasm-opt="z"` + `--enable-bulk-memory` params).
The `viewer-size` CI job fails if `dist/*_bg.wasm` exceeds the budget. Measured:
**291,879 B uncompressed / 106,753 B brotli** (budgets 1 MB / 350 KB).

**Renderer decision** ([`stage-3-svg-spike.md`](stage-3-svg-spike.md)): keep
SVG. The demo emits ~139 SVG elements (largest known corpus ~290), far below the
few-thousand switch threshold, and pan/zoom held ~120 fps (single O(1) `viewBox`
update). The `CanvasRenderer` stays a stub.

## Deferred (tracked in `TODOS.md`)

- **`T-REAL-CORPUS`** — the richer detail blocks (quotes/figures/tables/diffs/
  glossary/recipes) are skinned but inert until the schema widens.
- **`T-GRAPH-KBD-NAV`** — arrow-key spatial graph traversal (search/filter + Tab
  is the keyboard nav this stage).
- **`T-VIEWER-DIST-PACKAGING`** — how `dist/` reaches users (`cargo install
  ara-cli` can't serve generated assets) is a `0.1.0` release / Stage-4 concern.
- **`T-WASM-CLIPPY`** — now actionable: Stage 3 added `#[cfg(target_arch =
  "wasm32")]` code, so a wasm-target clippy job is worth adding.
- Any server/HTTP, live reload, figure streaming — Stage 4 (this stage adds only
  the `ManifestSource::Static` seam so Stage 4 slots in without a rewrite).
