//! `ara-core`: the shared core of the ARA viewer runtime.
//!
//! This crate holds all parsing, normalization, binding resolution, and DAG
//! layout for the ARA viewer. It is compiled to both native targets (used by
//! `ara-cli`) and `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (used by the browser client), so it
//! is the single source of truth that keeps the server and client from
//! drifting.
//!
